This folder contains two short video files showing very early development progress, providing a very simple example of using C++ with Unreal Engine's Blueprint scripting system (VFX, animations, basic AI behavior trees, etc.). This is an extremely bare bones example, with plans existing to update/change almost everything shown. Further media demonstrating progress on these updates will be added incrementally, with current background work involving features such as motion captured animations and Utility based AI.
