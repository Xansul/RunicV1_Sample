# RunicV1

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.


This is a sample of Runic, a project I've been slowly developing in my free time. The entirety of the project is currently stored through Azure Devops, as they offer free use of Git LFS. This GitHub repository contains some of the source code as a sample for viewing, however the most current code will always be on Azure, as that is where regular updates are pushed. Feel free to contact me if you would like to view the Azure repository.

Additionally, this sample is meant to demonstrate personal working knowledge of C++ and Computer Science fundamentals, as well as an ability to quickly learn, implement, and integrate with an existing codebase.
